=========

AirBridge is a communications library giving developers the ability to create apps which may 
communicate between mobile devices without any user setup, hardware or drivers.

To build demo you will need to download project zip file, expand locally, manually inlude libPulseFilterLib.a into
the local project then build and execute on test device.

The demo is a code example of how to use the libPulseFilterLib.a in other applications.
